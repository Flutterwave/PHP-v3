# Rave PHP SDK :wink:

> Class documentation can be found here [https://flutterwave.github.io/Flutterwave-Rave-PHP-SDK/packages/Default.html](https://flutterwave.github.io/Flutterwave-Rave-PHP-SDK/packages/Default.html)

Use this library to integrate your PHP app to Rave.

Edit the `paymentForm.php` and `processPayment.php` files to suit your purpose. Both files are well documented.

Simply redirect to the `paymentForm.php` file on your browser to process a payment.

The vendor folder is committed into the project to allow easy installation for those who do not have composer installed.
It is recommended to update the project dependencies using:

```shell
$ composer install
```

## Sample implementation

In this implementation, we are expecting a form encoded POST request to this script.
The request will contain the following parameters.

- payment_method `Can be card, account, both`
- description `Your transaction description`
- logo `Your logo url`
- title `Your transaction title`
- country `Your transaction country`
- currency `Your transaction currency`
- email `Your customer's email`
- firstname `Your customer's first name`
- lastname `Your customer's last name`
- phonenumber `Your customer's phonenumber`
- pay_button_text `The payment button text you prefer`
- ref `Your transaction reference. It must be unique per transaction.  By default, the Rave class generates a unique transaction reference for each transaction. Pass this parameter only if you uncommented the related section in the script below.`

```php
// Prevent direct access to this class
define("BASEPATH", 1);

## VirtualAccount Sample implementation

The following implementation shows how to create a virtual Account.
Please view the documentation for more options that can be added in the payload
https://developer.flutterwave.com/reference#create-a-virtual-account-number

require("Flutterwave-Rave-PHP-SDK/lib/VirtualAccount.php");
use Flutterwave\VirtualAccount;

$array = array(

```
## Preauth Sample implementation

Card preauthorisation allows a merchant preauthorise a specific amount to be paid by a customer. Once preauthorised successfully, a hold is put on the amount specified, and left for the merchant to capture that amount at a later time or date. Merchants after preauthorising can perform the following actions:void,refund, capture.
Please note that for each action there is a different payload to pass as an array.

```php
require("Flutterwave-Rave-PHP-SDK/lib/Preauth.php");
use Flutterwave\Preauth;

$array = array(
"PBFPubKey"=> "FLWPUBK-7adb6177bd71dd43c2efa3f1229e3b7f-X",
  "cardno"=> "5438898014560229",
  "charge_type"=> "preauth",
  "cvv"=> "812",
  "expirymonth"=> "08",
  "expiryyear"=> "20",
  "currency"=> "NGN",
  "country"=> "NG",
  "amount"=> "100",
  "email"=> "user@example.com",
  "phonenumber"=> "08056552980",
  "firstname"=> "user",
  "lastname"=> "example",
  "IP"=> "40.198.14",
  "txRef"=> "MC-12344358",//must be unique
  "redirect_url"=> "https://rave-web.herokuapp.com/receivepayment",
  "device_fingerprint"=> "69e6b7f0b72037aa8428b70fbe03986c"
);

$payment = new Preauth();
$result = $payment->accountCharge($array);//to charge to card
//$capturePayment = $payment->captureFunds($array);//note the payload ```$array``` for this would be different. refer to documentation //on data to be passed.
//print_r($capturePayment);
//$refundOrVoid = $payment->refundOrVoid($array);
//print_r($refundOrVoid);
print_r($result);
```
## Tokenized Charge Sample implementation

Once the charge and validation leg is complete for the first charge on the card, you can make use of the token for subsequent charges.

```php
require("Flutterwave-Rave-PHP-SDK/lib/TokenizedCharge.php");
use Flutterwave\TokenizedCharge;

$array = array(
"SECKEY":"FLWSECK-e6db11d1f8a6208de8cb2f94e293450e-X",
"token":"flw-t1nf-404dff6823ff91ce154f04dd40085b9e-m03k",
"currency":"NGN",
"country":"NG",
"amount":"100",
"email":"user@example.com",
"firstname":"Yemi",
"lastname":"Oyeleke",
"IP":"190.233.222.1",
"narration":"Internet Renewal",
"txRef":"MC_1522966555872",
"meta":""
);

$payment = new TokenizedCharge();
$result = $payment->tokenCharge($array);
//$updateEmailLinkedToToken = $payment->updateEmailTiedToToken($array);//updates email linked to the token
//print_r($updateEmailLinkedToToken);
//$bulkCharge = $payment->bulkCharge($array);//initiate bulk charges
//print_r($bulkCharge);
//$checkBulkStatus = $payment->bulkChargeStatus($array);//checks the status of the bulk charge.
//print_r($checkBulkStatus);
print_r($result);

## view Transactions Sample implementation

 list all transactions on your account. You could do a specific query using ```customer_email``` or ```customer_fullname``` to make specifc search. View all successfull or failed transactions for a particular period, month or year.
 Please read the MISCELLANEOUS section of the Api documentation for more option to pass.
 https://developer.flutterwave.com/reference#list-transactions 

```php
require("Flutterwave-Rave-PHP-SDK/lib/Transactions.php");
use Flutterwave\Transactions;

$array = array(
  "seckey"=> "Merchant secret key",
  "from"=>"2018-01-01",
  "to" => "2018-03-30",
  "currency" => "NGN",
  "status" => "successful" 
);

$payment = new Transactions();
$result = $payment->viewTransactions($array);
print_r($result);




You can also find the class documentation in the docs folder. There you will find documentation for the `Rave` class and the `EventHandlerInterface`.

Enjoy... :v:

## ToDo

- Write Unit Test
- Support Tokenized payment
