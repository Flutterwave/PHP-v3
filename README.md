<a id="requirements"></a>

## Requirements

1. Flutterwave for business [API Keys](https://developer.flutterwave.com/docs/integration-guides/authentication)

<a id="installation"></a>

## Installation

### Download Release Artifact
If you do not want to make use of composer. each [release](https://github.com/Flutterwave/PHP-v3/releases/) contains a zip with all the dependencies installed. Simply download the one that supports your php version.

### Installation via Composer.

To install the package via Composer, run the following command.
```shell
composer require flutterwavedev/flutterwave-v3
```

<a id="initialization"></a>

## Initialization

Create a .env file and follow the format of the `.env.example` file
Save your PUBLIC_KEY, SECRET_KEY, ENV in the `.env` file

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Your `.env` file should look this.

```env
FLW_PUBLIC_KEY=FLWSECK_TEST-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX-X
FLW_SECRET_KEY=FLWPUBK_TEST-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX-X
FLW_ENCRYPTION_KEY=FLWSECK_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
FLW_ENV='staging/production'
FLW_LOG_DIR=logs
```

### Render Payment Modal

The SDK provides two easy methods of making collections via the famous payment modal. [Learn more](#)

1. [Flutterwave Inline]( https://developer.flutterwave.com/docs/collecting-payments/inline )
2. [Flutterwave Standard]( https://developer.flutterwave.com/docs/collecting-payments/standard )

### Get Started



Edit the `paymentForm.php` and `processPayment.php` files to suit your purpose. Both files are well documented.

Simply redirect to the `paymentForm.php` file on your browser to process a payment.

In this implementation, we are expecting a form encoded POST request to this script.
The request will contain the following parameters.

```json

 {
    "amount": "The amount required to be charged. (*)",
    "currency": "The currency to charge in. (*)",
    "first_name": "The first name of the customer. (*)",
    "last_name" : "The last name of the customer. (*)",
    "email": "The customers email address. (*)",
    "phone_number": "The customer's phone number. (Optional).",
    "success_url": "The url to redirect customer to after successful payment.",
    "failure_url": "The url to redirect customer to after a failed payment.",
    "tx_ref":"The unique transaction identifier. if ommited the apiclient would generate one"
 }

```

The script in `paymentProcess.php` handles the request data via the `PaymentController`. If you are using a Framework like Laravel or CodeIgniter you might want to take a look at the [PaymentController](#)

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

# if vendor file is not present, notify developer to run composer install.
require __DIR__.'/vendor/autoload.php';

use Flutterwave\Controller\PaymentController;
use Flutterwave\EventHandlers\ModalEventHandler as PaymentHandler;
use Flutterwave\Flutterwave;
use Flutterwave\Library\Modal;

# start a session.
session_start();

try {
    Flutterwave::bootstrap();
    $customHandler = new PaymentHandler();
    $client = new Flutterwave();
    $modalType = Modal::POPUP; // Modal::POPUP or Modal::STANDARD
    $controller = new PaymentController( $client, $customHandler, $modalType );
} catch(\Exception $e ) {
    echo $e->getMessage();
}

if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] === "POST") {
    $request = $_REQUEST;
    $request['redirect_url'] = $_SERVER['HTTP_ORIGIN'] . $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'];
    try {
        $controller->process( $request );
    } catch(\Exception $e) {
        echo $e->getMessage();
    }
}

$request = $_GET;
# Confirming Payment.
if(isset($request['tx_ref'])) {
    $controller->callback( $request );
} else {
    
}
exit();

```
<br>

### Configuration settings
Create a .env file and add the bootstrap method first before initiating a charge.
```php
use \Flutterwave\Flutterwave;

# normal configuration
Flutterwave::bootstrap(); # this will use the default configuration set in .env
```

if you do not wish to use a .env, you can simply pass your API keys like the example below.

```php
use \Flutterwave\Helper\Config;

$myConfig = Config::setUp(
    'FLWSECK_TEST-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX-X',
    'FLWPUBK_TEST-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX-X',
    'FLWSECK_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX',
    'staging'
);
 
Flutterwave::bootstrap($myConfig);
````

## Testing

All of the SDK's tests are written with PHP's ```phpunit``` module. The tests currently test:
```Account```,
```Card```,
```Transfer```,
```Preauth```,
```Collection Subaccount```,
```Payout Subaccount```,
```Subscriptions``` and
```Paymentplan```

They can be run like so:

```sh
phpunit
```

>**NOTE:** If the test fails for creating a subaccount, just change the ```account_number``` ```account_bank```  and ```businesss_email``` to something different

>**NOTE:** The test may fail for account validation - ``` Pending OTP validation``` depending on whether the service is down or not
